As a Staff Software Engineer and Manager at Google, I work in the Semantic Perception team led by [Federico Tombari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TFsE4BIAAAAJ&hl=en), focusing on AR technology, specifically privacy-aware ambient perception, On-Device Generative LLMs, and 3D computer vision.

Before Google, I worked on sensitive document classification and built the deterministic encryption stack for DLP API. I also spent time at Yelp and Facebook, focusing on anti-abuse and security initiatives such as login detection, phishing prevention, and bug triage using ML.

My interests are centered around Generative machine learning, security, and privacy.
