As a [Staff Software Engineer and Manager](https://www.linkedin.com/in/achinkul/) at [Google](https://arvr.google.com/), I work in the Semantic Perception team led by [Federico Tombari](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=TFsE4BIAAAAJ&hl=en), focusing on AR technology, specifically privacy-aware ambient perception, On-Device Generative LLMs, and 3D computer vision. Before AR Perception, I worked on sensitive document classification and built the [deterministic encryption stack for DLP API](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/take-charge-of-your-data-how-tokenization-makes-data-usable-without-sacrificing-privacy).

I also spent time at Yelp and Facebook, focusing on anti-abuse and security initiatives such as account takeover protection, phishing prevention, and bug triage using ML.

My interests are centered around Generative ML, computer vision and privacy.
